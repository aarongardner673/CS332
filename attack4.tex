\section{Jay's attack}

Social engineering is a type of confidence trick or also might be described as a psychological manipulation of people to get them to perform some desired action or to divulge sensitive information for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access. It is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. Social engineering has been used very often
successfully among computer and information security professionals.
The techniques used for social engineering are based on specific attributes of human decision making known as cognitive biases. These biases can be thought of as bugs in the human hardware, which can be exploited in various combinations that create opportunity for specific attack techniques, some of which will be covered in this paper.
